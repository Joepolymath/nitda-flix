## CONTRIBUTING

- Never push to the main branch
- Never push to the staging branch
- Never push to the develop branch
- Everytime you want to make contribution, always checkout into the develop branch, run `git pull`, and checkout into your new branch.

- Naming convention for branches should be in the form `<your-name>/feature/feature-name`. Eg. `josh/feature/video-encoding`. For fixes, `<your-name>/fix/fix-name`. For patches, `<your-name>/patch/patch-name`.
- After changes are made, push your branch to the repository and raise a pull request against the develop branch. Add me(Joshua) as a reviewer to your pull request.
